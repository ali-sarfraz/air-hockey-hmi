 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * This Doxygen documentation page is intended to provide information related to the source code used in developing the Care-Hockey Table HMI project.
 * The project goal is to create a HMI or UI for an air-hockey table having the additional features of accessability controls and autonomous opponent play.
 * Due to development being constrained to a virtualization of the Raspberry PI platform, the air-hockey table and its features were emulated through the code
 * developed. Additional project functionality includes the storage of previous game data in an associated database. A visualized breakdown of the project can be viewed
 * below.
